<h2 style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:rgb(255,165,0);text-decoration:underline;">Personal Information</h2>

<p style="font-family:Courgette;color:White;">

<Strong>Name:</Strong> Rob Flanagan<br><Strong>Student Number:</Strong> s3807139<br><Strong>Email:</Strong> robflanagan88@gmail.com<br><Strong>Interests:</Strong> Surfing, music, 
guitar, computers, gaming, golf, soccer, rugby and other team sports.<br></p>

<h2 style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:rgb(255,165,0);text-decoration:underline;">Interest In IT</h2>

<p style="font-family:Courgette;color:White;">

From the moment my family bought our first Macintosh computer in the early 1990's, I was hooked on computers from enjoying using the software to building Pentium PC's. When I got my 
Sony PlayStation 1 I fell instantly in love with computer/console games. Years later and numerous computers, consoles and portable devices later I still have the same passion to buy, build, play, pull apart and fix such devices. 
Later in my high school years I found another interest linking all of these different peripherals together: programming.  After learning Realbasic in high school and later learning C++ and Visualbasic at university I knew I would 
always keep these skills even just as a hobby. After a number of years pursuing other fields of study and work I kept returning to my passion with building computers and pc/console gaming. These constant reminders assured me that I 
should turn this hobby into a career. I choose to study at RMIT as it had the perfect start date and flexible study timetable to suit my needs. Currently I am working large hours in a small coastal town with the only business 
being a general store. The external online study of 2 subjects starting every 13 weeks was perfect for my needs. I expect to learn how to program in a number of languages, using a number of programming tools, during the life 
of my course and continue to improve my ever expanding problem solving skills.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:rgb(255,165,0);text-decoration:underline;">Ideal Job</h2>

<p style="font-family:Courgette;color:White;">

<img src="Ideal Job 1.PNG" alt="Ideal Job: description" style="margin-right:20px;border:10px solid black;float:left;width:400px;height:575px;">	

My ideal job would be something very similar to this <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39088920?searchrequesttoken=051000c8-99f1-425a-8530-438ad50edcc9&type=promoted">Mobile Application Developer</a> position found on seek.com.au. 
This position would require me to lead the frontend and backend development of applications on both android an iOS. The role would be to create and maintain multiple apps that work across both platforms. This would be ideal for me 
because I love to create projects across varying number of personal interests such as music and computing.<br><br>
The skills required to be a successful candidate for a role such as this is include years of experience in the mobile device development industry, experience with iOS and android development, experience in a number of programming 
languages such as React Native, Redux and experience with PHP programming. It would also require a sound understanding of the development cycle of mobile applications and require experience using a number of development tools such 
as Git, Babel, webpack, Gulp, NPM, Karma and/or Grant. While having experience with iOS 10/11 or higher as a necessity, the role would also require database experience in MySQL and NoSQL, experience with 3rd party application 
programming interfaces and a solid comprehension of web-based security.<br><br>
As of now, my skills are limited to some basic Java, C++, Visualbasic and Realbasic experience. I also have some ground knowledge on using Git and Github. I plan to increase my understanding of these programming languages and 
programming tools and learn many other necessary programming skills over the next 3 years while I complete my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. To further increase my chances of achieving the required criteria for a 
role similar to this, I plan to take a number of courses to build on my knowledge that would take me further down the path of a mobile application developer.</p>

After answering a series of 100 personality questions in an online <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">Myer-Briggs Test</a> the resulting personality was a Logician. While rare, logicians are a valuable 
team member for any creative workplace as their intellect and unique perspective gives them unrivalled creativity and inventiveness. Logicians make great analysts or strategists and have an original, imaginative and open minded 
perspective with an honest and straightforward enthusiasm. While slow to form certain working relationships and can be private and withdrawn, logicians work at their best with another person.<br><br>
After completing an <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">Online Learning Style Test</a> my learning style was determined to be a combination of an auditory and a visual learner. 
Both of these learning styles have been my study methods during high school and university exams in the past and have helped me excel in mathematics and sciences. A great example of this is the Read-Write-Repeat study method with uses 
both those learning styles.<br><br>
Finally the last test I completed was an <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/">Online Creativity Test</a> which gave me an average but also unique result. While obtaining almost an identical creative score to the majority of people 
tested I was over the average in the connection, complexity and paradox sectors. These three creative metrics allow me to remember large amounts of information, accept contradictory statements and find connections with things that 
arenâ€™t obvious or apparent. All of these metrics in combination with other team members unique creative attributes come together to form a dynamic workgroup.<br></p>

<h2 style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:rgb(255,165,0);text-decoration:underline;clear:both;"><br>Project Ideas</h2>

<h4 style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:rgb(255,165,0);">Overview</h2>

<p style="font-family:Courgette;color:White;">

The project I will be building will be a 2D side-scrolling platform game using the Unity program. The user will move the character through some levels to fight a final boss. This will require 
programming some Javascript or preferably C# to accomplish this. After viewing some basic tutorials and videos I am confident I can complete the project and will learn quite a lot of valuable skills in programming languages and 
programming tools along the way. This project will provide a great quantity of experience necessary to achieve a job in the programming industry and specifically a job like the one listed above.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:rgb(255,165,0);">Motivation</h2>

<p style="font-family:Courgette;color:White;">For years I have enjoyed playing computer, console and mobile games of all types and genres. However, the older I get I find myself becoming less excited for the newer games and more detached 
from the new gaming generations releases and feel like I could make something more appealing to not only myself but to others of my age group. While this goal is quite a journey away from where my skillset currently lies at the moment, 
I strongly feel that given the time to learn how to program that my objective can definitely be achieved.

<h4 style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:rgb(255,165,0);">Description</h2>

<p style="font-family:Courgette;color:White;">

The project I plan to develop will be a 2D side scrolling platform game. There have been many games like this to draw inspiration from however the main reason for choosing to create this 
type of game in Unity is not only is it a smaller game to build thus lowering the required build and completion time, but there are numerous helpful guides and tutorials and videos online. This project is merely to showcase the skills 
I have learned so far in this course and will highlight the 13 weeks of study I have done so far. Trying to create a AAA game would require years and years of work so it is important to be realistic with the limited amount of time that 
I have to complete this project and choose something much, much smaller in size. I personally feel that with the limited time available I can create a small number of levels with a boss battle level at the end.<br><br>
The game will have a character or hero which will be required to move from left to right across a small number of levels avoiding, jumping and manoeuvring numerous obstacles and occasionally fighting some monsters or some other form of enemy. 
If the character moves within a specific range of the enemies they will move towards the character and start to attack the character. Upon being hit the character will die and respawn. If they die too many times then it will be 
game over and they will have to begin the game again. The final level will be a boss battle that upon completion will end the game. The game will have some 8 bit music that is symbolic of the gaming genre at the time and have a small 
number of other sounds such as jumping noises and enemy noises. The story line will be very basic if existent at all as the goal of this project is not intended to develop my story telling but intended to build on and test my ability 
to program and create clean and efficient code in a new programming language.
</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:rgb(255,165,0);">Tools & Technologies</h2>

<p style="font-family:Courgette;color:White;">

The main programming tool I will be using will be Unity game development platform. Unity is a content creation engine that is able to be used from beginners all the way up to corporate giant 
companies. It can be used to make both 2D and 3D games and is the worlds most widely used content creation engine. While unity is programmed using C#, users can use Javascript, C# or Boo programming languages to write the code. Unity 
also provides a number of services such as analytics, certifications, cloud building, collaborations, diagnostics, multiplayer and the asset store.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:rgb(255,165,0);">Skills Required</h2>

<p style="font-family:Courgette;color:White;">

One of the biggest required skills is obviously programming in either C# or Javascript. While programming in Unity with Javascript is possible the C# language is much more preferable. 
With this in mind, viewing some basic C# tutorials on websites or YouTube will be a much-needed requirement if I am to complete this project in the easiest and most efficient way possible. Another required skill is the use and control 
of the unity asset store. While the majority of the asset store costs money to download and use there are some free samples and objects that will greatly improve project efficiency. This will save a lot of time that would otherwise be 
spent designing or drawing visuals such as playable characters, background images and other utilities and technologies.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Bradley Hand ITC;color:rgb(255,165,0);">Outcome</h2>

<p style="font-family:Courgette;color:White;">

With the vast amounts of tutorials, videos and other forms of help online I feel that I can accomplish this goal and complete this project on time. This project will give me a great 
understanding of the requirements of game development and will teach me some very valuable lessons and experiences along the way. Not only that but it will add a significant portion of necessary experience and the required skills for 
a future job requirement such as my ideal job listed above and further increase my motivation to continue learning and experiencing the never-ending technology that is computer programming.</p>
